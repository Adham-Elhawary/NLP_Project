🚀 Excited to share one of our recent college projects! 🧠📚

As part of our Natural Language Processing course, my team and I developed an English-Arabic Machine Translation and Evaluation System using deep learning. Our goal was to create a complete, user-friendly tool that supports translation, evaluation, and visualization for Arabic NLP tasks.

🔍 Project Workflow:

📊 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing:
We worked with English-Arabic datasets (from Kaggle and OPUS), applied text cleaning, normalization, and tokenization to prepare high-quality input for our models.

🧠 2. Model Development:
We implemented:
🔹 MarianMT (Hugging Face) for English-Arabic translation
🔹 Fine-tuning support to adapt models to custom data

📈 3. Evaluation:
We measured model performance using BLEU, MAE, MSE, and accuracy, giving clear insights into translation quality.

📊 4. Visualization:
Using Plotly and Matplotlib, we created interactive visualizations to explore datasets and model results.

💻 5. GUI Development:
We built a Tkinter-based multi-tab GUI that allows users to:
➡ Translate text
➡ Evaluate model outputs
➡ Visualize data and metrics

🎯 What I Learned:
✅ Building translation models with MarianMT and Hugging Face
✅ Preprocessing and handling bilingual datasets
✅ Designing interactive GUIs with Tkinter
✅ Creating evaluation pipelines and visualization dashboards
